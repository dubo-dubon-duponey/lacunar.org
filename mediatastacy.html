      <p>1- Aristotle's comment "to be human is only human"
        resonates today as a - warning; we need only say "nothing
        but" to radicalize the meaning: an eradication of all that
        is human. The tautological nomenclature Sapiens sapiens is
        evidence enough of an original, fundamental, fault. The
        knowing subject ends by realizing that he/she is part of a
        cycle in which close to 99% of all known species having ever
        existed are extinct. A vague foreshadowing of our own
        extinction, this threat inspires in our species a "series of
        countermeasures" to avoid what we do not wish to acknowledge
        as inevitable. Taking destiny into our own hands by
        manipulating to our own advantage the inexorable
        transformations linked to the mutational cycles of the
        universe has become the dominant illusion of Sapiens
        sapiens. This error in perspective resides in the fact that
        our destiny cannot be disassociated from that of the
        World-as-it-is, which defies comprehension. Under the
        pretext of changing our destiny, we jury-rig the inhuman
        mutational process. From the <i>technè</i> to the
        techno-scientific machinery, this error has followed a
        process of assisted evolution which speeds toward its
        terminal goal, the radicalization of fatality. The
        Technological machine is founded on an insurmountable
        paradox to which there is no other alternative than the
        (super-compulsive) rise of its "desire of desires" which
        leads to substituting a fatal reality (the first kind) with
        a second ultra-fatal reality (called virtual), where we drag
        things on, prolong them in somewhat the same manner that
        chemotherapy drags on the life of a metastasized organism.
        The enormous means by which the globally networked
        Technological machine arms itself for survival will play the
        role of metastacy - the chemotherapy becomes the cancer. The
        general theory of information with which the Technological
        machine is fed, a system open to its own excesses, carries a
        virus specific to media: mediatastacy.</p>
      <p>2- The syndrome is true today for the management of
        planetary politics, for the European Balkans, for Africa,
        for the Caucasus, and to-day dramatically -- re the
        Middle-East --, for any region where capitalistic machinery
        is "taking care of" that part of the Global Market judged
        incompatible with inclusion in its evolutionary process (and
        vice versa). Madness and absolute crime (as an expression of
        the second ultra-fatal reality) reaches such an intolerable
        level that the global conscience actively pretends to take
        the grim events in hand with the sole intention of turning
        the intolerable into a ethical-religious standard (the World
        Trade Center, one uses the horrible events to better invert
        it to the profit of the Market or to the extension of an
        industrial and military power with a suspicious
        monotheistical guarantee.) The mutilated corpses and mass
        graves warn that a critical limit has been reached,
        releasing the activist discourse of a disappearing act, the
        corpse and the mound become the vector of the ideology of
        extinction. We witness a real period of mourning. A period
        of enforced mourning. Cancer is an anticipated mourning,
        mediatastacy gives birth to the enforced mourning period in
        which we attempt with all our might to forget the
        intolerable. The good news would be that information that
        hides the corpses -- that incorporates death by including it
        in its inverted therapy -- becomes itself deathlike. It has
        not other rule than itself, it gives itself up to its own
        disguised corruption.</p>
      <p>3- To the call of the ethical-humanitarian propaganda
        apparatus - which is normally nourished on the imagery of
        victims and deplores «&nbsp;the absolute destitution of the
        population caught in the midst of fratricidal combats&nbsp;»
        echoes the reasurring "soteriological" voice of
        informational activism: «&nbsp;Life will return to normal,
        markets are open, people are returning home, elections will
        take place...&nbsp;» A whole proactivist movement is deployed
        in the disappearance of the corpses - a ritualized act of
        white magic -, whose goal is to transform the horrible event
        into a contingent episode through political, informational,
        counter informational, commissional, congregational,
        academic, politico-geo-economic activism. This is how, all
        things considered, humanism becomes revisionist. Here
        information follows a reshaping, or even genetic reworking
        logic, in order to neutralize the traditional idea of a
        sovereign living being.</p>
      <p>4. But reworked according to what time-scale? That of the
        nurturing nature of the World-as-it-is or that of the
        microprocessor? Mediatastacy corrupts the notion of time. It
        seems rather normal that eradicating a major bug in living
        organisms would result in the decomposition of the classical
        predicates of the original version. Statements such as, "the
        destitution of a people held hostage" and "there is no
        problem in the Great Lakes [region of Africa]" take part in
        the same dialectic of anticipated extinction&nbsp;; the
        terrifying nature of this language gives rise to a new one&nbsp;:
        transmuted and pataphysical (not serious), the only way to
        create a new logical system, one which foreshadows the
        extinction of humanity and the victory of inhuman
        technological values. Will it bring the return of a new
        eschatological time-scale? Or, more elegant, the emergence
        of mythical figures&nbsp;? The return of the Titans? Could it be
        that the only way we can understand the destiny of man is
        with the aid of mythological representations?</p>
      <p>5- The Technological machine, as the product of a
        destined double intelligence, results in the algorithmic
        doubling back of this fate, to the benefit of a humanity
        reconstructed by means of a therapeutic program whose goal
        is humanities own (metastic) end. A double paradox following
        two Original Errors? The first being the one which led to
        the development of the tools necessary for the
        transformation of living beings. " The original error common
        to both speciation (transformation of life) and
        carcino-genesis is a change in the genome, chromosomic or
        genetic. [...] Evolution has given man an intelligence
        unique on earth and controlled by an exceedingly complex
        constellation of genes. Cancer too appears with a selfish
        intelligence, death bearing and also governed by an
        exceedingly complex constellation of genes. Metastacy is the
        startling and fatal proof." (J. de Grouchy, <i>Is Man
          Creations Cancer?</i>) The second is the about take of
        knowledge caught in the trap of its own intolerable
        binomality (its oncogenetic double-bind); meta[static]
        linguistic which contaminates the event by the way it
        "genetically" transforms things&nbsp;: brushing aside the
        emotional content of the event by reducing it to its purely
        functional, technical and redundant aspects. This
        mediatastic manipulation of information thinks up its cancer
        the way thought thinks on thought, in a circular feedback
        which aims to set the intolerable to one side of the body
        whose signifying function of the affect it metastacizes.
      </p>
      <p>6- If the rhetoric of disappearance participates in a
        purely Darwinian form of evolution -and thus selection of
        species - the mutation operates in two ways: an extinction
        (of life or meaning) and a meta-linguistics which
        neutralizes the emotional impact thus destroying the
        intolerable meaning of the extinction by anticipating it
        through all manner of manipulations (including genetic). The
        hospital kills charity: the conscience has joined its object
        and both will disappear in the myth of a new man&nbsp;: new but
        pacified. It seems as if the Technological machine, the
        recycling bin of traditional mythology entirely transformed,
        has appropriated the metaphysics of mother nature. Why not
        turn evolution over to the hand of " man"? We patch up the
        event in the same manner we try to patch up and rid the body
        of its faults. CADS (computer assisted design of species) is
        taking place and a " new man" is on his way, a new body is
        being born <i>deus ex machina</i> from a band of compulsive
        humanoides, not counting those without access to the
        means... Once again, will it be the "unpredictable" that
        haunts every overly systematic enterprise? Its bane? Its
        subtractive horizon.</p>
      <p>7- It is no laughing matter and it has no name&nbsp;: the
        Unspeakable. Allowing a genocide to occur, mass graves to
        seed the landscape, allowing the food chain to be corrupted
        and pollution to poison -- to then take action, pretending,
        at least at first, that it's important, updating the world
        in real time while <i>at the same time</i> burying the
        events in a rhetoric of triviality: all are part of strong
        and unprecedented symbolism. A mythology of modern pathos,
        of impure intelligence (converting the natural emotion into
        a neutral one), to disguise the horror is to enter the realm
        of the unspeakable. But the unspeakable has penetrated to
        the very heart of the Technological mechanism itself,
        unspoken but active: metastic. A review of de Bataille and
        Nietzsche is useful here; every quanta of fictional action
        finds its affectation in the Hegelian circularity where the
        play (The Tragedy) of homogeneity takes place.</p>
      <p>8- The insane, the unspeakable, fatalism, the
        heterogeneous, the virus of the infinite have broken into
        the norm. If that can happen, then we can imagine that the
        cursed part of our species can be recycled in the "new
        norm". Is the inhuman thus ready to become a consensual
        value, aiding a cohort of mutants to cross the stream of an
        artificial time to a new episode of the species? A
        transfiguration of the original Error in the form of a new
        (biological) incarnation?</p>
      <p>9- The Judaeo-Christian error (Guilt) should have clued
        us in regarding this. Is this the refinancing of a
        paleo-anthropological Original Error -- the massacre of the
        Neanderthals committed by the latest biological model?
        Divine barter or barter divine&nbsp;: «&nbsp;Without our
        permission - our <i>League</i> - you shall not destroy life&nbsp;», says the All Powerful of the Fable, -
        «&nbsp;using one we conspire against the other, but in
        My name...&nbsp;»&nbsp;But the proliferation of the species
        can only lead to the disintegration of this type of League.
        Moses: willful recurring fault as the generator of the Law:
        «&nbsp;Walk in my footsteps or you will go nowhere;
        Obey or you will have no Promised Land.&nbsp;» And Jesus,
        the other Other, He of the enfeebled Fable (Nietzsche):
        «&nbsp;I am suffering incarnate, suffer-me, suffer for
        me, gather yourselves around mine own to deliver yourselves
        from Offense.&nbsp;» The buying back of sins is still barter.
        From the gravity of a conscience troubled by a primordial
        mistake we pass to the frivolous (barter): word games, words
        of revelation, theology, scolasticness, a whole meta system
        to lead to an ideological reorganization of the extinction
        of faulty bodies. Frivolous, the body, but clever like
        Paul-the saint. Clever like a virus today.</p>
      <p>10- Will Art become the art of revealing ancient and
        modern lapsus&nbsp;? The intelligence, not of knowledge but of
        the madness of knowledge and its linguistic disguises. Will
        art become the esthetic pleasure which transcends (Bataille
        would say 'trandescendant') the strategy by which the
        species, by ever more subversive means of values subversion
        tries to play with, by rendering esthetic, its own
        extinction -- an our-days-are-numbered 'edge-of-the-abyss
        esthetics' contemplating the disastrous beauty of the void.
        Neither serious nor grave nor grotesque, but simply
        pathetic, because it is prophetically clear that the
        original pathos of the body (as yet still embodied of its
        biological anomalies) is hidden in radical reserve at the
        heart of all technological stands... Held at reserve in the
        privacy of the initiatic micro-circles for bi-encephalic
        bodies with one head looking at the past, the other
        squinting into the future...</p>

      <p>«&nbsp;Mythical or hyperbolic cancer&nbsp;: why do we so fear
        the word, as if behind it we could see written the
        unspeakable? <i>Because it attacks the code</i> by the
        authority of which we, living and choosing to live are kept
        in the security of a purely formal existence, obeying a
        standardized signage of a program whose process is normative
        from one end to the other. Cancer symbolizes and realizes a
        refusal to respond&nbsp;: a cell which refuses to respond to
        orders, which develops out of order, in anarchical fashion,
        and more: it destroys the very idea of a program, renders
        doubtful the exchanges of messages and the possibility to
        reduce everything to the simulation of symbols. Cancer, in
        this view, is a political phenomenon, one of the rare ways
        to dislocate the system, to disrupt the program and
        universal signifiers by proliferation and disorder, a task
        once played by leprosy and later, the Plague. Something we
        poorly understand maliciously neutralized the master-plan.
        Its not causing death that cancer is a special menace&nbsp;: it
        is a mortal disordering more frightening than death which
        gives it the trait of being uncounted and uncountable, in
        the same manner that suicide disappears from the statistics
        which try to take it into account.&nbsp;»</p>
      <p>One need only perform a symbolic transfer from physiology
        of the body to the whole plural human system starting with
        its new mediatastic Logos and then examine the disruptions
        which we are privy to. This includes the transgenic
        manipulations of plants and the danger of environmental
        contamination which it implies. Genetic manipulation and the
        will to transfiguration (c.f. Tibon-Cornillot), and the
        general overload inflicted on information are two sides of
        the same coin. We might ask ourselves if we are merely
        witnessing the pursuit by human mediation of the very
        natural transformation of species. <font color="#AF0000">In
          this case, that which disrupts the norm (and that which up
          till now in terms of individual philosophy/ethics, or that
          of small political groups was a sign of health, of revolt,
          of counterbalance or unknowing) is provoking, by a
          subtractive effect, the contrary of that which the powerful
          technoscientific cocktail is trying to avoid</font>. Against
