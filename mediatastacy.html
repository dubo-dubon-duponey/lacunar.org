      <TD VALIGN=top>
         <P>1- Aristotle's comment "to be human is only human"
         resonates today as a - warning; we need only say "nothing
         but" to radicalize the meaning: an eradication of all that
         is human. The tautological nomenclature Sapiens sapiens is
         evidence enough of an original, fundamental, fault. The
         knowing subject ends by realizing that he/she is part of a
         cycle in which close to 99% of all known species having ever
         existed are extinct. A vague foreshadowing of our own
         extinction, this threat inspires in our species a "series of
         countermeasures" to avoid what we do not wish to acknowledge
         as inevitable. Taking destiny into our own hands by
         manipulating to our own advantage the inexorable
         transformations linked to the mutational cycles of the
         universe has become the dominant illusion of Sapiens
         sapiens. This error in perspective resides in the fact that
         our destiny cannot be disassociated from that of the
         World-as-it-is, which defies comprehension. Under the
         pretext of changing our destiny, we jury-rig the inhuman
         mutational process. From the <I>technè</I> to the
         techno-scientific machinery, this error has followed a
         process of assisted evolution which speeds toward its
         terminal goal, the radicalization of fatality. The
         Technological machine is founded on an insurmountable
         paradox to which there is no other alternative than the
         (super-compulsive) rise of its "desire of desires" which
         leads to substituting a fatal reality (the first kind) with
         a second ultra-fatal reality (called virtual), where we drag
         things on, prolong them in somewhat the same manner that
         chemotherapy drags on the life of a metastasized organism.
         The enormous means by which the globally networked
         Technological machine arms itself for survival will play the
         role of metastacy - the chemotherapy becomes the cancer. The
         general theory of information with which the Technological
         machine is fed, a system open to its own excesses, carries a
         virus specific to media: mediatastacy.</P>

         <P>2- The syndrome is true today for the management of
         planetary politics, for the European Balkans, for Africa,
         for the Caucasus, and to-day dramatically -- re the
         Middle-East --, for any region where capitalistic machinery
         is "taking care of" that part of the Global Market judged
         incompatible with inclusion in its evolutionary process (and
         vice versa). Madness and absolute crime (as an expression of
         the second ultra-fatal reality) reaches such an intolerable
         level that the global conscience actively pretends to take
         the grim events in hand with the sole intention of turning
         the intolerable into a ethical-religious standard (the World
         Trade Center, one uses the horrible events to better invert
         it to the profit of the Market or to the extension of an
         industrial and military power with a suspicious
         monotheistical guarantee.) The mutilated corpses and mass
         graves warn that a critical limit has been reached,
         releasing the activist discourse of a disappearing act, the
         corpse and the mound become the vector of the ideology of
         extinction. We witness a real period of mourning. A period
         of enforced mourning. Cancer is an anticipated mourning,
         mediatastacy gives birth to the enforced mourning period in
         which we attempt with all our might to forget the
         intolerable. The good news would be that information that
         hides the corpses -- that incorporates death by including it
         in its inverted therapy -- becomes itself deathlike. It has
         not other rule than itself, it gives itself up to its own
         disguised corruption.</P>

         <P>3- To the call of the ethical-humanitarian propaganda
         apparatus - which is normally nourished on the imagery of
         victims and deplores «&nbsp;the absolute destitution of the
         population caught in the midst of fratricidal combats&nbsp;»
         echoes the reasurring "soteriological" voice of
         informational activism: «&nbsp;Life will return to normal,
         markets are open, people are returning home, elections will
         take place...&nbsp;» A whole proactivist movement is deployed
         in the disappearance of the corpses - a ritualized act of
         white magic -, whose goal is to transform the horrible event
         into a contingent episode through political, informational,
         counter informational, commissional, congregational,
         academic, politico-geo-economic activism. This is how, all
         things considered, humanism becomes revisionist. Here
         information follows a reshaping, or even genetic reworking
         logic, in order to neutralize the traditional idea of a
         sovereign living being.</P>

         <P>4. But reworked according to what time-scale? That of the
         nurturing nature of the World-as-it-is or that of the
         microprocessor? Mediatastacy corrupts the notion of time. It
         seems rather normal that eradicating a major bug in living
         organisms would result in the decomposition of the classical
         predicates of the original version. Statements such as, "the
         destitution of a people held hostage" and "there is no
         problem in the Great Lakes [region of Africa]" take part in
         the same dialectic of anticipated extinction ; the
         terrifying nature of this language gives rise to a new one :
         transmuted and pataphysical (not serious), the only way to
         create a new logical system, one which foreshadows the
         extinction of humanity and the victory of inhuman
         technological values. Will it bring the return of a new
         eschatological time-scale? Or, more elegant, the emergence
         of mythical figures ? The return of the Titans? Could it be
         that the only way we can understand the destiny of man is
         with the aid of mythological representations?</P>

         <P>5- The Technological machine, as the product of a
         destined double intelligence, results in the algorithmic
         doubling back of this fate, to the benefit of a humanity
         reconstructed by means of a therapeutic program whose goal
         is humanities own (metastic) end. A double paradox following
         two Original Errors? The first being the one which led to
         the development of the tools necessary for the
         transformation of living beings. " The original error common
         to both speciation (transformation of life) and
         carcino-genesis is a change in the genome, chromosomic or
         genetic. [...] Evolution has given man an intelligence
         unique on earth and controlled by an exceedingly complex
         constellation of genes. Cancer too appears with a selfish
         intelligence, death bearing and also governed by an
         exceedingly complex constellation of genes. Metastacy is the
         startling and fatal proof." (J. de Grouchy, <I>Is Man
         Creations Cancer?</I>) The second is the about take of
         knowledge caught in the trap of its own intolerable
         binomality (its oncogenetic double-bind); meta[static]
         linguistic which contaminates the event by the way it
         "genetically" transforms things : brushing aside the
         emotional content of the event by reducing it to its purely
         functional, technical and redundant aspects. This
         mediatastic manipulation of information thinks up its cancer
         the way thought thinks on thought, in a circular feedback
         which aims to set the intolerable to one side of the body
         whose signifying function of the affect it metastacizes.
         </P>

         <P>6- If the rhetoric of disappearance participates in a
         purely Darwinian form of evolution -and thus selection of
         species - the mutation operates in two ways: an extinction
         (of life or meaning) and a meta-linguistics which
         neutralizes the emotional impact thus destroying the
         intolerable meaning of the extinction by anticipating it
         through all manner of manipulations (including genetic). The
         hospital kills charity: the conscience has joined its object
         and both will disappear in the myth of a new man : new but
         pacified. It seems as if the Technological machine, the
         recycling bin of traditional mythology entirely transformed,
         has appropriated the metaphysics of mother nature. Why not
         turn evolution over to the hand of " man"? We patch up the
         event in the same manner we try to patch up and rid the body
         of its faults. CADS (computer assisted design of species) is
         taking place and a " new man" is on his way, a new body is
         being born <I>deus ex machina</I> from a band of compulsive
         humanoides, not counting those without access to the
         means... Once again, will it be the "unpredictable" that
         haunts every overly systematic enterprise? Its bane? Its
         subtractive horizon.</P>

         <P>7- It is no laughing matter and it has no name : the
         Unspeakable. Allowing a genocide to occur, mass graves to
         seed the landscape, allowing the food chain to be corrupted
         and pollution to poison -- to then take action, pretending,
         at least at first, that it's important, updating the world
         in real time while <I>at the same time</I> burying the
         events in a rhetoric of triviality: all are part of strong
         and unprecedented symbolism. A mythology of modern pathos,
         of impure intelligence (converting the natural emotion into
         a neutral one), to disguise the horror is to enter the realm
         of the unspeakable. But the unspeakable has penetrated to
         the very heart of the Technological mechanism itself,
         unspoken but active: metastic. A review of de Bataille and
         Nietzsche is useful here; every quanta of fictional action
         finds its affectation in the Hegelian circularity where the
         play (The Tragedy) of homogeneity takes place.</P>

         <P>8- The insane, the unspeakable, fatalism, the
         heterogeneous, the virus of the infinite have broken into
         the norm. If that can happen, then we can imagine that the
         cursed part of our species can be recycled in the "new
         norm". Is the inhuman thus ready to become a consensual
         value, aiding a cohort of mutants to cross the stream of an
         artificial time to a new episode of the species? A
         transfiguration of the original Error in the form of a new
         (biological) incarnation?</P>

         <P>9- The Judaeo-Christian error (Guilt) should have clued
         us in regarding this. Is this the refinancing of a
         paleo-anthropological Original Error -- the massacre of the
         Neanderthals committed by the latest biological model?
         Divine barter or barter divine : «&nbsp;Without our
         permission - our <I>League</I> - you shall not destroy life
       &nbsp;», says the All Powerful of the Fable, -
         «&nbsp;using one we conspire against the other, but in
         My name...&nbsp;»&nbsp;But the proliferation of the species
         can only lead to the disintegration of this type of League.
         Moses: willful recurring fault as the generator of the Law:
         «&nbsp;Walk in my footsteps or you will go nowhere;
         Obey or you will have no Promised Land.&nbsp;» And Jesus,
         the other Other, He of the enfeebled Fable (Nietzsche):
         «&nbsp;I am suffering incarnate, suffer-me, suffer for
         me, gather yourselves around mine own to deliver yourselves
         from Offense.&nbsp;» The buying back of sins is still barter.
         From the gravity of a conscience troubled by a primordial
         mistake we pass to the frivolous (barter): word games, words
         of revelation, theology, scolasticness, a whole meta system
         to lead to an ideological reorganization of the extinction
         of faulty bodies. Frivolous, the body, but clever like
         Paul-the saint. Clever like a virus today.</P>

         <P>10- Will Art become the art of revealing ancient and
         modern lapsus ? The intelligence, not of knowledge but of
         the madness of knowledge and its linguistic disguises. Will
         art become the esthetic pleasure which transcends (Bataille
         would say 'trandescendant') the strategy by which the
         species, by ever more subversive means of values subversion
         tries to play with, by rendering esthetic, its own
         extinction -- an our-days-are-numbered 'edge-of-the-abyss
         esthetics' contemplating the disastrous beauty of the void.
         Neither serious nor grave nor grotesque, but simply
         pathetic, because it is prophetically clear that the
         original pathos of the body (as yet still embodied of its
         biological anomalies) is hidden in radical reserve at the
         heart of all technological stands... Held at reserve in the
         privacy of the initiatic micro-circles for bi-encephalic
         bodies with one head looking at the past, the other
         squinting into the future...</P>

         <P>«&nbsp;Mythical or hyperbolic cancer : why do we so fear
         the word, as if behind it we could see written the
         unspeakable? <I>Because it attacks the code</I> by the
         authority of which we, living and choosing to live are kept
         in the security of a purely formal existence, obeying a
         standardized signage of a program whose process is normative
         from one end to the other. Cancer symbolizes and realizes a
         refusal to respond : a cell which refuses to respond to
         orders, which develops out of order, in anarchical fashion,
         and more: it destroys the very idea of a program, renders
         doubtful the exchanges of messages and the possibility to
         reduce everything to the simulation of symbols. Cancer, in
         this view, is a political phenomenon, one of the rare ways
         to dislocate the system, to disrupt the program and
         universal signifiers by proliferation and disorder, a task
         once played by leprosy and later, the Plague. Something we
         poorly understand maliciously neutralized the master-plan.
         Its not causing death that cancer is a special menace : it
         is a mortal disordering more frightening than death which
         gives it the trait of being uncounted and uncountable, in
         the same manner that suicide disappears from the statistics
         which try to take it into account.&nbsp;»</P>

         <P>One need only perform a symbolic transfer from physiology
         of the body to the whole plural human system starting with
         its new mediatastic Logos and then examine the disruptions
         which we are privy to. This includes the transgenic
         manipulations of plants and the danger of environmental
         contamination which it implies. Genetic manipulation and the
         will to transfiguration (c.f. Tibon-Cornillot), and the
         general overload inflicted on information are two sides of
         the same coin. We might ask ourselves if we are merely
         witnessing the pursuit by human mediation of the very
         natural transformation of species. <FONT COLOR="#AF0000">In

         of counterbalance or unknowing) is provoking, by a
