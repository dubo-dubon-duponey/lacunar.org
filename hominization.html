<B><I>Homo sapiens at a crossroads: the ambiguity of modern
technology</I></B></P>
<P>Is the evolution of technology moving in the direction of a
transformation of the body, or rather in the opposite direction- its
conservation. Humanity finds itself in a rather strange situation of
a widening difference between two time scales, the geological scale
of bodily transformation, and that of technical transformation, at
the scale of generations <SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">13</FONT></SUP>. The
process by which "exuded" and autonomized technologies allow humans
to maintain their cultural heritage creates a problem because the gap
is widening between a social and technical universe transforming at a
dizzying rate and "man of flesh and blood, a veritable living fossil,
unchanging on a historical scale, perfectly adapted to the time when
he triumphed over the mammoth, but already obsolete at the time his
muscles "grew" claws<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">14</FONT></SUP>.</P>
<P>Technology is thus deployed along two different orientations,
intricately tied together. It has permitted humans to considerably
increase their mastery over their environment, to invade ever-larger
numbers of ecological niches and to expulse or conquer the living
beings that occupied them. The process of control which developed
over so many thousands of years was enabled by another movement by
which the human species has systematically projected out of itself,
in the form of tools, machines, domesticated animals, etc.
instruments which permitted the augmentation of his performances.
They were thus able to maintain the geological rhythm of their bodily
transformation and maintain a state of readiness and immaturity,
which makes the incessant process of learning possible.</P>
<P>The profound purpose of the technological sphere is not the same
as that which characterizes the activism of occidental rationality at
work in the sciences, that is, the general project of reconstructing
both the world and man. However, to the extent that traditional
technical processes have entered little by little into the internal
logic of modern science which has both transformed and dynamized
them, they are part and parcel of the vast movement of control and
transformation which animates the techno-scientific mix. Should we
thus deduce that techniques have been so profoundly reworked that
they have no other destiny than inclusion in the destiny of the
sciences: to transform the world and particularly the human body? Or
should we consider on the contrary that modern technical objects,
manipulations and instruments are still rooted in the dynamic of
maintaining bodily integrity and preserving the geological rhythm of
evolution which the human species is undergoing? In this case, modern
techno-scientific activity, oriented toward a radical transformation
of the human species, would be more contradictory than it would seem
at first glance, demanding ever greater efforts on the part of its
technical half to resist change. What elements do we have to shed
light on this matter?</P>
<P>We have constantly reaffirmed the autonomy of technical processes
and the deep links which unite them to the human body as well as to
other living beings. Do they not liberate human beings from the
derivatives of biological specialization which would distance us from
the "immaturity" which is the source of our creative potential?</P>
<P>Nonetheless, the analyses of Leroi-Gourhan is not entirely
satisfying. When he expounded it, in the fifties, biotechnology had
not yet been invented. How could we ignore that technical creativity
had played a major role in the perfection of processes by which the
human species has, in a matter of decades, gained access to
hereditary material and the ability to transform it to his own ends?
We are obliged to recognize that our developments lead to
contradictory results: different from the sciences in their purpose
and their relation to the human body, responsible for preserving the
integrity of our species for thousands of years, technology now plays
a privileged role in its transformation. Could it be that
technologies close relationship to the scientific approach and its
Promethean activism caused it to lose its vital connection to the
human body at the heart of the hominization which they maintained for
so long?</P>
<P>I am going to try to steer a course between myth, hypothesis, and
scientific data in an attempt to show that this contradiction at the
heart of modern technology does not change their independent status.
</P>
<P><B><I>Hominization as a Sickness and technology as a
treatment</I></B></P>
<P>Technology and science play an incontestable role in the delicate
position we find ourselves in (the nuclear balancing act), however,
our basic diagnostic must not be twisted by the confusion and sophism
mentioned earlier: the confusion of technology with science, the
mythical existence of a "healthy" individual and collective life, the
maniacal anthropocentrism which constantly confuses the destiny of
life with that of humanities because we see in our history the
progressive emergence of the truth of our own evolution to our
stupefied eyes.</P>
<P>The deeper reality of our condition is even less glorious, and to
understand it, technology is a good starting point. Modern man is
caught between the archaic aggressiveness of a clever omnivorous and
warring predator and the extravagance of his modern means of
destruction acquired thanks to secular cultural activity. The
permanence of our most archaic instincts makes triggering a nuclear
conflagration plausible and even, I might add, inevitable. This
situation, in which humanities most primitive elements can manifest
themselves through its most refined cultural developments, is neither
due to a confusion of being and beings nor to an original fault, but
simply to a grave sickness of which we have already described several
symptoms and which needs to be described in greater detail.</P>
<P><B><I>Hominization, bipedal locomotion and cerebral-spinal
development</I></B></P>
<P>The location of the geographic hearth of the species which
participated in the process of hominization is now fairly precisely
known to be in Africa between the Rift Valley and the Indian Ocean.
It is there that palaeontologists have discovered "skeletal remains
and tools of 2,3,4,5,6 and possibly ten million years old.<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1">15</FONT></SUP>" It is there, at Hadar, in modern Ethiopia,
that an entire skeleton of a Pliocene hominid "Lucy" of the species
Australopithecus afarensis was found. In the same region, Tim Whites
team has just found significant remains (45 percent) of an adult
Australopithecus ramidus, older even than afarensis. "This evolution
of hominids is accompanied by all the anatomic, biochemical and
cytogenic evidenceÉnecessary to show that we are cousins of the
panids<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">16</FONT></SUP>". Our distant cousins were
largely located in the west of the Rift valley, where forests lay,
for which wooded environment they are well adapted with their
brachiation and their Quadra pedal locomotion. Modern palaeontology
has clearly shown that the distribution of the panids (gorillas and
chimps) and that of the hominids (Australopithecus and the first
"men") occurs neatly on one side of the Rift valley and the other.
This is the demarcation line which changing sea levels and
precipitation led to, with the west remaining wooded and the east
seeing its wood cover reduced and an opening of its
landscape.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">17</FONT></SUP>"</P>
<P>The systematic study of the geological and climatic evolution of
Africa during the period of hominization shows a general movement
from humid to less humid: "the wooded savannah became more and more
open toward 3 million years ago and changed rather drastically by
2,200,000 years ago to the point of resembling a veritable steppe.
All this seems to point to the fact that the landscape played a role,
perhaps even a crucial role in the selection of these two hominids to
an open and clearly dangerous environment where they were vulnerable,
Australopithecus boisei protected by its size, Homo habilis aided by
the development of his central nervous systemÉthe conjunction with
the "great divide" causing them to adapt to a dryer and less wooded
environment.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">18</FONT></SUP>"</P>
<P>It is this adaptation to a new environment which allows us to
understand the key element in human evolution, bipedal locomotion; it
is in any case what we observe in Homo habilis, "the epitome of the
dominant primate of the arid savannah, omnivorous biped,
opportunistic, tool-making and sociable, cunning and prudent,
self-aware and talkative."<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">19</FONT></SUP>
Bipedal locomotion came first: the cerebral-spinal development was a
consequence, which A. Leroi-Gourhan strove to show in a good part of
his book<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">20</FONT></SUP>.</P>
<P>The anatomical reorganization which permitted the development of
the nervous system of hominids is centred on the decisive influence
of the forces on the vertebrae constituting the spinal column of our
ancestors. The vertebrae were compressed and stacked like a pile of
saucers; the neural tube was enlarged, which allowed the development
of the spinal cord. The back of the skull was also freed and the
visual field enlarged due to the new rotary freedom of the skull
which found itself "balanced" on the spinal column. Upright posture
also freed the hands and creates a dynamic frontal space. It is the
freeing of the hands which signal the end of using the mouth to
forage or to interact directly with the environment, allowing a
greater sensitivity of the lips and tongue. Tongue, lips, and throat,
freed from fiber and soil thus were given the qualities which allowed
the articulation of language<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">21</FONT></SUP>.
</P>
<P>In the description of the processes liberated by bipedal
locomotion, none is the direct cause of the other. They need to be
understood in terms of a mutually reinforcing group of determining
factors which permitted the freeing to the back of the skull and the
accompanying development of the telencephalic cortex at the precise
time when the physiological possibility of language development
appeared. It seems likely that the development of the cerebral-spinal
system allowed a qualitative leap: the systematic use of language.
Language in turn became involved in technical creativity in what was
clearly a crucial time in human evolution. There was an important
shift from the dominance of bipedal locomotion in the evolution of
hominids which permitted their cerebral-spinal development to the
moment when the latter's extraordinary evolution extended its
hegemony over all of human development.</P>
<P><B><I>Cerebral-spinal development: representations and the birth
of anxiety.</I></B></P>
<P>It is not the present purpose to seek a meaning in the emergence
of reflective consciousness associated with cerebral-spinal
development, but to ask if its breathtakingly rapid development might
have had other, non-adaptive side effects with serious consequences
for humanity. Its development allowed the birth of a representational
world, the appearance of subjectivity, mnemonic capabilities and
foresight, in other words, everything that makes up human temporal
experience. These capacities are the basis of culture but are also
the generators of a fundamental angst which characterizes our
species. The study of evolution shows us the adaptive advantages of
sexual reproduction and the death of each genetic carrier<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1">22</FONT></SUP>. Each individual carrier of the human
genotype, representative of one sex, tends to mix with other carriers
and, once the reproductive period is over, to die and thus leave the
field open for future generations of human genetic carriers. The
diversity of carriers permits a rapid weeding out of mutations which
are "marginal" and a rapid diffusion of beneficial characteristics:
the multiplicity of carriers also guarantees a rapid spatial
diffusion which is the best guarantee of protection against exterior
environmental events. However, while this process is an integral part
of the human species, each individual is cognizant of his own death
and feels the disappearance of those close to him or her as an almost
intolerable loss.</P>
<P><B><I>From over determining to over development</I></B></P>
<P>The reason for the enormous difference between the experience of
most mammals and that of humans is well known and rests, once again,
on the central nervous system, which induces the birth of a
representational domain, memory, and other intellectual operations,
for which, though we don't know exactly how, it is the physical
support. It is also clear that the appearance of a representational
domain and thus existential temporalism renders the classical
mammalian experience insufferable for man.</P>
<P>By acquiring the possibility of representing oneself by
anticipation of one's death and that of one's loved ones, by being
able to recall compulsively ones past, we live in a constantly
explosive situation, between our mortal destiny and our aspirations
and desires, a situation which is a constant source of anxiety and
stress.</P>
<P>What has just been said is in part conjecture but also part
reflection based on the observations of palaeontologists and shares
some common ground with philosophical traditions. The present context
sheds new light on Nietzsche's and Freud's analysis of human
illnesses. Applied to Freud, these hypotheses can be used to
interpret psychic development. These observations also give new force
to the distinction proposed by Claude Lévi-Strauss between
traditional "cool" societies and modern "warm" societies:
industrialized and rapidly evolving<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1">23</FONT></SUP>. If we accept that humanity and its works
are to a large degree determined by a search for solutions reducing
the source of this angst, we can consider that collective solutions
have developed in two directions which correspond precisely to the
distinction proposed by Lévi-Strauss.</P>
<P>The first orientation and the answers it provided to such a dark
destiny consisted essentially of collective representations and a
control of individual subjective experience. Traditional societies
seem to be characterized by a two pronged movement: a check on the
uncontrolled development of the individuals representational field, a
disapproval of subjectivity, and the creation of a constraining
representational system regarding life and death; death becoming a
test, a necessary passage before entry to paradise or the "great
hunting ground in the sky". These collective responses proved highly
efficient in their control of the individual and their particularly
annoying habit of becoming aware of their real situation.</P>
<P><B><I>Modern technology and the transfiguration of the
body</I></B></P>
<P>The response of traditional societies has disappeared; the few
remaining traces such as "tribal revival movements" or "world music"
show the radical nature of this loss. For occidental man, enemy of
emotional pathos, this type of response has little meaning. Christian
societies helped breach the traditional regulations in favour of a
faith, which itself has worn thin over the centuries. At the same
time, modern societies have given great importance to individual
subjectivity, first in its Christian form, then in the secular
political subjectivity of citizens and the economic subjectivity of
consumers. Occidental, societies, "warm" societies, are characterized
by an extra-ordinary reinvigoration of the anxiogenic structures
linked to the over development of the nervous system, a situation all
the more explosive following the collapse of Christian mythology. In
this new situation, there are only two possibilities to reduce this
fundamental angst. The first lies in collective suicide and has the
advantage of ending the problem once and for all. This solution is
unfortunately well on its way to completion and has the disadvantage
of killing many other species who are not at all responsible for our
problems. Although collective suicide is a real possibility, it has
little interest from a point of view of reflection and action because
it would end them, and it is ethically inconceivable because it would
include a number of imminently respectable species in the disaster.
</P>
<P>There remains another solution which is to promote cultural
developments, particularly scientific and technological, which,
linked to the development of the central nervous system and the
representational field it induces, would be capable of modifying the
human body and psychology. It is to this end that occidental culture
has moved since the end of the Middle Ages. The birth of science and
the multiplier effect they had on the explosion of technology is the
path by which humanity hopes to find a way around its fate. A good
part of science and technology operates in a strategic theatre which
is the human body which it wishes to transform to reduce anxiety and
end suffering. The massive movement of technology around the human
body and in the development of procedures to control living material
can be interpreted from this point of view. The inhuman face which
science and technology all to often present can be ascribed to this
movement towards the death of the traditional human body in order to
substitute a remodelled body which no longer carries the
insupportable death of the old model.</P>
<P>It is necessary to search far into our past, back to our shadowy
origins where hominians have emerged, in order to understand the
meaning of this possible dissolution of the human body and the
enormous effort of forging a new destiny. By the way, it is
inaccurate to claim that men <I>search</I> for forging a destiny; we
are perhaps only trying to master an original destiny even more
terrible which with great skill and perseverance we are trying to
shed - with no tears and no regrets.</P>
