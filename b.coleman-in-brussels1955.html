  <section>
    <p>Sometime, in the mid 50s, the trumpet player
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Coleman">Bill Coleman</a>
      (or was is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Nicholas">Albert Nicholas</a> on clarinet - both played
      with us at that time) was in concert at the Brussels University - ULB
      - with <cite>Johnny GELDER &amp; his
        New-Orleans Jazz Band</cite>.</p>
    <p>
      Some German students came over specially from
      Frankfurt or München and recorded the full concert. Who are
      they, are they still, where are they&nbsp;? Does
      this original document still exist&nbsp;?
    </p>
    <p>
      We are interested in any information or tips
      concerning those hours of a top Jazz moment with these rare
      musicians.

    <h3>Brief history of Jazz
      in Brussels</h3>
    <strong>
      La Rose Noire
    </strong>

    <p>The great Jazz period started in the
      40s in Brussels.<br>
      1950: Louis Laydu opened "La Rose Noire" (inspired by the parisian
      "La Rose Rouge", meeting point of the top emerging French and
      confirmed American Jazz stars). Louis' brother, Jean-Jacques, started
      the first New-Orleans jazz band in Belgium with John Gelder at the
      banjo. A well known family, the Laydu's, at that time; a third
      brother, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Laydu">Claude Laydu</a>
      had his fame as an actor in <cite>
        <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_d%27un_cur%C3%A9_de_campagne_(film)">Le Journal d'un curé de campagne</a>
      </cite>
      of <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bresson">Robert Bresson</a>.
      When Jean-Jacques left, John Gelder - who in
      the meantime had adopted the clarinet and the soprano saxo -, founded
      his New-Orleans Jazz-band with J. Phanis at the piano, L. Bodache at
      the drums, H. Carels at the trumpet, Claude George at the trombone,
      R. Colmand at the Guitar, Benoît Guersain at the
      Bass, offering a full Old style repertoire (the then popular Louis
      Armstrong's Hot-Five & Hot-Seven) and middle-jazz. They toured in
      Belgium and France, with hosts like Bill Coleman and Albert
      Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>The Rose Noire, Petite rue des Bouchers, in the
      centre of Brussels, two steps ahead from the "Grande Place", was
      during a decade the meeting point of Jazz, rallying and initiating a
      growing young public. Many international Stars who performed in
      Brussels in concert came to the Rose as free guests&nbsp;: members from
      the crew of Ellington, Basie, Dizzy, Clifford Brown, Parker… Some
      exclusive nights, occasional guests, like Roy Elridge, Django
      Reinhardt and the now (inter)national star Toots Thielemans joined
      the Gelder-Band for jam sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early-fifties, at the small "Grenier" on the first
  floor of La Rose Noire, a young Belgian "Chanteur-compositeur",
  started modestly his career&nbsp;: Jacques Brel. At three or four
  tables, groovy couples where flirting and sipping wine without much
  attention for that guy with his rough voice singing one of his firsts
  songs, <cite>Quand on n'a que
  l'amour</cite>. <q>He grumbled, because of what he
      called the horrible noise our group made on the ground-floor</q>, says
  Gelder.<br>
  Late fifties&nbsp;: Brel was on his way to become an international star,
      <cite>La Rose Noire</cite> closed its doors, Bop Jazz and Rock made their
  coming-in… and replaced the dixieland period.
