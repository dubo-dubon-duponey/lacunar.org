      <h3>Homo sapiens at a crossroads: the ambiguity of modern
        technology</h3>

      <p>Is the evolution of technology moving in the direction of a
        transformation of the body, or rather in the opposite direction- its
        conservation. Humanity finds itself in a rather strange situation of
        a widening difference between two time scales, the geological scale
        of bodily transformation, and that of technical transformation, at
        the scale of generations <sup>13</sup>. The
        process by which "exuded" and autonomized technologies allow humans
        to maintain their cultural heritage creates a problem because the gap
        is widening between a social and technical universe transforming at a
        dizzying rate and "man of flesh and blood, a veritable living fossil,
        unchanging on a historical scale, perfectly adapted to the time when
        he triumphed over the mammoth, but already obsolete at the time his
        muscles "grew" claws<sup>14</sup>.</p>
      <p>Technology is thus deployed along two different orientations,
        intricately tied together. It has permitted humans to considerably
        increase their mastery over their environment, to invade ever-larger
        numbers of ecological niches and to expulse or conquer the living
        beings that occupied them. The process of control which developed
        over so many thousands of years was enabled by another movement by
        which the human species has systematically projected out of itself,
        in the form of tools, machines, domesticated animals, etc.
        instruments which permitted the augmentation of his performances.
        They were thus able to maintain the geological rhythm of their bodily
        transformation and maintain a state of readiness and immaturity,
        which makes the incessant process of learning possible.</p>
      <p>The profound purpose of the technological sphere is not the same
        as that which characterizes the activism of occidental rationality at
        work in the sciences, that is, the general project of reconstructing
        both the world and man. However, to the extent that traditional
        technical processes have entered little by little into the internal
        logic of modern science which has both transformed and dynamized
        them, they are part and parcel of the vast movement of control and
        transformation which animates the techno-scientific mix. Should we
        thus deduce that techniques have been so profoundly reworked that
        they have no other destiny than inclusion in the destiny of the
        sciences: to transform the world and particularly the human body? Or
        should we consider on the contrary that modern technical objects,
        manipulations and instruments are still rooted in the dynamic of
        maintaining bodily integrity and preserving the geological rhythm of
        evolution which the human species is undergoing? In this case, modern
        techno-scientific activity, oriented toward a radical transformation
        of the human species, would be more contradictory than it would seem
        at first glance, demanding ever greater efforts on the part of its
        technical half to resist change. What elements do we have to shed
        light on this matter?</p>
      <p>We have constantly reaffirmed the autonomy of technical processes
        and the deep links which unite them to the human body as well as to
        other living beings. Do they not liberate human beings from the
        derivatives of biological specialization which would distance us from
        the "immaturity" which is the source of our creative potential?</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the analyses of Leroi-Gourhan is not entirely
        satisfying. When he expounded it, in the fifties, biotechnology had
        not yet been invented. How could we ignore that technical creativity
        had played a major role in the perfection of processes by which the
        human species has, in a matter of decades, gained access to
        hereditary material and the ability to transform it to his own ends?
        We are obliged to recognize that our developments lead to
        contradictory results: different from the sciences in their purpose
        and their relation to the human body, responsible for preserving the
        integrity of our species for thousands of years, technology now plays
        a privileged role in its transformation. Could it be that
        technologies close relationship to the scientific approach and its
        Promethean activism caused it to lose its vital connection to the
        human body at the heart of the hominization which they maintained for
        so long?</p>
      <p>I am going to try to steer a course between myth, hypothesis, and
        scientific data in an attempt to show that this contradiction at the
        heart of modern technology does not change their independent status.

      <h3>Hominization as a Sickness and technology as a
        treatment</h3>
      <p>Technology and science play an incontestable role in the delicate
        position we find ourselves in (the nuclear balancing act), however,
        our basic diagnostic must not be twisted by the confusion and sophism
        mentioned earlier: the confusion of technology with science, the
        mythical existence of a "healthy" individual and collective life, the
        maniacal anthropocentrism which constantly confuses the destiny of
        life with that of humanities because we see in our history the
        progressive emergence of the truth of our own evolution to our
        stupefied eyes.</p>
      <p>The deeper reality of our condition is even less glorious, and to
        understand it, technology is a good starting point. Modern man is
        caught between the archaic aggressiveness of a clever omnivorous and
        warring predator and the extravagance of his modern means of
        destruction acquired thanks to secular cultural activity. The
        permanence of our most archaic instincts makes triggering a nuclear
        conflagration plausible and even, I might add, inevitable. This
        situation, in which humanities most primitive elements can manifest
        themselves through its most refined cultural developments, is neither
        due to a confusion of being and beings nor to an original fault, but
        simply to a grave sickness of which we have already described several
        symptoms and which needs to be described in greater detail.</p>

      <h3>Hominization, bipedal locomotion and cerebral-spinal
        development</h3>
      <p>The location of the geographic hearth of the species which
        participated in the process of hominization is now fairly precisely
        known to be in Africa between the Rift Valley and the Indian Ocean.
        It is there that palaeontologists have discovered "skeletal remains
        and tools of 2,3,4,5,6 and possibly ten million years old.<sup>15</sup>" It is there, at Hadar, in modern Ethiopia,
        that an entire skeleton of a Pliocene hominid "Lucy" of the species
        Australopithecus afarensis was found. In the same region, Tim Whites
        team has just found significant remains (45 percent) of an adult
        Australopithecus ramidus, older even than afarensis. "This evolution
        of hominids is accompanied by all the anatomic, biochemical and
        cytogenic evidence necessary to show that we are cousins of the
        panids<sup>16</sup>". Our distant cousins were
        largely located in the west of the Rift valley, where forests lay,
        for which wooded environment they are well adapted with their
        brachiation and their Quadra pedal locomotion. Modern palaeontology
        has clearly shown that the distribution of the panids (gorillas and
        chimps) and that of the hominids (Australopithecus and the first
        "men") occurs neatly on one side of the Rift valley and the other.
        This is the demarcation line which changing sea levels and
        precipitation led to, with the west remaining wooded and the east
        seeing its wood cover reduced and an opening of its
        landscape.<sup>17</sup>"</p>
      <p>The systematic study of the geological and climatic evolution of
        Africa during the period of hominization shows a general movement
        from humid to less humid: "the wooded savannah became more and more
        open toward 3 million years ago and changed rather drastically by
        2,200,000 years ago to the point of resembling a veritable steppe.
        All this seems to point to the fact that the landscape played a role,
        perhaps even a crucial role in the selection of these two hominids to
        an open and clearly dangerous environment where they were vulnerable,
        Australopithecus boisei protected by its size, Homo habilis aided by
        the development of his central nervous systemÉthe conjunction with
        the "great divide" causing them to adapt to a dryer and less wooded
        environment.<sup>18</sup>"</p>
      <p>It is this adaptation to a new environment which allows us to
        understand the key element in human evolution, bipedal locomotion; it
        is in any case what we observe in Homo habilis, "the epitome of the
        dominant primate of the arid savannah, omnivorous biped,
        opportunistic, tool-making and sociable, cunning and prudent,
        self-aware and talkative."<sup>19</sup>
        Bipedal locomotion came first: the cerebral-spinal development was a
        consequence, which A. Leroi-Gourhan strove to show in a good part of
        his book<sup>20</sup>.</p>
      <p>The anatomical reorganization which permitted the development of
        the nervous system of hominids is centred on the decisive influence
        of the forces on the vertebrae constituting the spinal column of our
        ancestors. The vertebrae were compressed and stacked like a pile of
        saucers; the neural tube was enlarged, which allowed the development
        of the spinal cord. The back of the skull was also freed and the
        visual field enlarged due to the new rotary freedom of the skull
        which found itself "balanced" on the spinal column. Upright posture
        also freed the hands and creates a dynamic frontal space. It is the
        freeing of the hands which signal the end of using the mouth to
        forage or to interact directly with the environment, allowing a
        greater sensitivity of the lips and tongue. Tongue, lips, and throat,
        freed from fiber and soil thus were given the qualities which allowed
        the articulation of language<sup>21</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>In the description of the processes liberated by bipedal
        locomotion, none is the direct cause of the other. They need to be
        understood in terms of a mutually reinforcing group of determining
        factors which permitted the freeing to the back of the skull and the
        accompanying development of the telencephalic cortex at the precise
        time when the physiological possibility of language development
        appeared. It seems likely that the development of the cerebral-spinal
        system allowed a qualitative leap: the systematic use of language.
        Language in turn became involved in technical creativity in what was
        clearly a crucial time in human evolution. There was an important
        shift from the dominance of bipedal locomotion in the evolution of
        hominids which permitted their cerebral-spinal development to the
        moment when the latter’s extraordinary evolution extended its
        hegemony over all of human development.</p>

      <h3>Cerebral-spinal development: representations and the birth
        of anxiety.</h3>
      <p>It is not the present purpose to seek a meaning in the emergence
        of reflective consciousness associated with cerebral-spinal
        development, but to ask if its breathtakingly rapid development might
        have had other, non-adaptive side effects with serious consequences
        for humanity. Its development allowed the birth of a representational
        world, the appearance of subjectivity, mnemonic capabilities and
        foresight, in other words, everything that makes up human temporal
        experience. These capacities are the basis of culture but are also
        the generators of a fundamental angst which characterizes our
        species. The study of evolution shows us the adaptive advantages of
        sexual reproduction and the death of each genetic carrier<sup>22</sup>. Each individual carrier of the human
        genotype, representative of one sex, tends to mix with other carriers
        and, once the reproductive period is over, to die and thus leave the
        field open for future generations of human genetic carriers. The
        diversity of carriers permits a rapid weeding out of mutations which
        are "marginal" and a rapid diffusion of beneficial characteristics:
        the multiplicity of carriers also guarantees a rapid spatial
        diffusion which is the best guarantee of protection against exterior
        environmental events. However, while this process is an integral part
        of the human species, each individual is cognizant of his own death
        and feels the disappearance of those close to him or her as an almost
        intolerable loss.</p>
    </section>
    <section>

      <h3>From over determining to over development</h3>
      <p>The reason for the enormous difference between the experience of
        most mammals and that of humans is well known and rests, once again,
        on the central nervous system, which induces the birth of a
        representational domain, memory, and other intellectual operations,
        for which, though we don’t know exactly how, it is the physical
        support. It is also clear that the appearance of a representational
        domain and thus existential temporalism renders the classical
        mammalian experience insufferable for man.</p>
      <p>By acquiring the possibility of representing oneself by
        anticipation of one’s death and that of one’s loved ones, by being
        able to recall compulsively one's past, we live in a constantly
        explosive situation, between our mortal destiny and our aspirations
        and desires, a situation which is a constant source of anxiety and
        stress.</p>
      <p>What has just been said is in part conjecture but also part
        reflection based on the observations of palaeontologists and shares
        some common ground with philosophical traditions. The present context
        sheds new light on Nietzsche’s and Freud’s analysis of human
        illnesses. Applied to Freud, these hypotheses can be used to
        interpret psychic development. These observations also give new force
        to the distinction proposed by Claude Lévi-Strauss between
        traditional "cool" societies and modern "warm" societies:
        industrialized and rapidly evolving<sup>23</sup>. If we accept that humanity and its works
        are to a large degree determined by a search for solutions reducing
        the source of this angst, we can consider that collective solutions
        have developed in two directions which correspond precisely to the
        distinction proposed by Lévi-Strauss.</p>
      <p>The first orientation and the answers it provided to such a dark
        destiny consisted essentially of collective representations and a
        control of individual subjective experience. Traditional societies
        seem to be characterized by a two pronged movement: a check on the
        uncontrolled development of the individuals representational field, a
        disapproval of subjectivity, and the creation of a constraining
        representational system regarding life and death; death becoming a
        test, a necessary passage before entry to paradise or the "great
        hunting ground in the sky". These collective responses proved highly
        efficient in their control of the individual and their particularly
        annoying habit of becoming aware of their real situation.</p>

    </section>
    <section>

      <h3>Modern technology and the transfiguration of the body</h3>
      <p>The response of traditional societies has disappeared; the few
        remaining traces such as "tribal revival movements" or "world music"
        show the radical nature of this loss. For occidental man, enemy of
        emotional pathos, this type of response has little meaning. Christian
        societies helped breach the traditional regulations in favour of a
        faith, which itself has worn thin over the centuries. At the same
        time, modern societies have given great importance to individual
        subjectivity, first in its Christian form, then in the secular
        political subjectivity of citizens and the economic subjectivity of
        consumers. Occidental, societies, "warm" societies, are characterized
        by an extra-ordinary reinvigoration of the anxiogenic structures
        linked to the over development of the nervous system, a situation all
        the more explosive following the collapse of Christian mythology. In
        this new situation, there are only two possibilities to reduce this
        fundamental angst. The first lies in collective suicide and has the
        advantage of ending the problem once and for all. This solution is
        unfortunately well on its way to completion and has the disadvantage
        of killing many other species who are not at all responsible for our
        problems. Although collective suicide is a real possibility, it has
        little interest from a point of view of reflection and action because
        it would end them, and it is ethically inconceivable because it would
        include a number of imminently respectable species in the disaster.
      </p>
      <p>There remains another solution which is to promote cultural
        developments, particularly scientific and technological, which,
        linked to the development of the central nervous system and the
        representational field it induces, would be capable of modifying the
        human body and psychology. It is to this end that occidental culture
        has moved since the end of the Middle Ages. The birth of science and
        the multiplier effect they had on the explosion of technology is the
        path by which humanity hopes to find a way around its fate. A good
        part of science and technology operates in a strategic theatre which
        is the human body which it wishes to transform to reduce anxiety and
        end suffering. The massive movement of technology around the human
        body and in the development of procedures to control living material
        can be interpreted from this point of view. The inhuman face which
        science and technology all to often present can be ascribed to this
        movement towards the death of the traditional human body in order to
        substitute a remodelled body which no longer carries the
        insupportable death of the old model.</p>
      <p>It is necessary to search far into our past, back to our shadowy
        origins where hominians have emerged, in order to understand the
        meaning of this possible dissolution of the human body and the
        enormous effort of forging a new destiny. By the way, it is
        inaccurate to claim that men <i>search</i> for forging a destiny; we
        are perhaps only trying to master an original destiny even more
        terrible which with great skill and perseverance we are trying to
        shed - with no tears and no regrets.</p>
